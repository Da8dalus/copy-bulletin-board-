Dr. Sarah Stein is a married mother of 5 and a pediatric gastroenterologist. She is also the president of an elementary school PTA. Dr. Stein's time spent away from her children and the hospital is precious. She often finds herself stuck in front of a copy machine at the elementary school, making hundreds of copies and distributing them to over forty classrooms. This is an ineffecient use of Dr. Stein's time. The Bulletin Board site would enable her to communicate with the school community remotely and effeciently. This means she could help another patient or spend more quality time with her children. It would also mean saving money on the schools budget, having to spend less on ink, paper, and upkeep of the machines. Additionally, the website provides easier access to divorced parents and to those whose children struggle with orginizational skills. Subsequently, the PTA has to spend less time and resources following up.
