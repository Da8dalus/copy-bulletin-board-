Our website is a social media platform created for educators. Its intention is to improve communication speed and accuracy. The target audiences for this website are younger studentsâ€™ caretakers and their educators. We intend to create a website that has a feed of posts created by the educators that can be interacted with. There will be two types of accounts, educators and parents/guardians.  We believe that this is doable using what we have learned. 

Features:

1. Feed of Educator Posts
Stay updated on the latest announcements, achievements, and educational content.

2. User-friendly Interface
Intuitive design to ensure a user-friendly experience for both educators and parents/guardians.
Easily navigate through the platform to access relevant information for different classes

3. Account Types
Two account types: Educator and Parent/Guardian.
Educators can share posts and communicate with parents/guardians.
Parents/Guardians can interact with posts and stay informed about their child's education.
